# Team Saudi Eagles (wro) future engineers
# Description:-

Since the inception of the 'Saudi Eagles' project, our team has been driven by a singular vision: to engineer a vehicle that seamlessly integrates mechanical, electrical, and artificial intelligence capabilities into a cohesive unit. Through persistent effort and determination, we have successfully developed a system that is both autonomous and efficient, carefully selecting components that enhance the overall performance of our vehicle.

One of the most significant challenges we faced was achieving harmonious interaction among the various elements of the vehicle without compromising any of its operational dynamics. This required extensive research and innovative problem-solving to ensure that each component worked effectively with the others.

Our vehicle is constructed using a lightweight aluminum chassis, which contributes to its agility and efficiency. It is powered by a 12V rechargeable lithium battery, ensuring sustainability and extended functionality. The vehicle utilizes an Arduino-compatible board, coupled with a dedicated motor drive control system. To enhance its navigational capabilities, we have incorporated three ultrasonic sensors that measure distance from three distinct directions. Additionally, a color sensor is included to detect colors on various surfaces, while an artificial intelligence camera is equipped with multiple programs for color and object recognition.

An interactive screen has been integrated into the system to display real-time footage from the camera, allowing for better operational oversight. To control the direction of the vehicle, a servo motor is employed for steering, complemented by a differential mechanism that effectively transfers power from a single motor to two wheels. The vehicle is designed with wide rubber wheels and motors capable of operating at 300 rpm, providing both stability and speed.

In the development phase, we exercised meticulous care in writing our code, scrutinizing each line to eliminate errors and ensure robust software performance. To reinforce the reliability of our programming, we developed two distinct code versions and conducted multiple tests on the vehicle. This rigorous testing process was essential to confirm the precision of our work and to guarantee that our achievements were not merely coincidental, but rather the result of careful planning and execution. 

Through these efforts, we are proud to present a vehicle that not only meets our initial goals but also sets a foundation for future advancements in autonomous vehicle technology.

# Ultrasonic sensor US - 100 :

An ultrasonic sensor is a device that uses ultrasonic sound waves to detect the distance to an object, such as the walls or pillars. An ultrasonic sensor transmits and receives ultrasonic pulses using a transducer to determine the proximity of an item. We put two ultrasonics, one on the left , the second one in right of our car, and the third one in front, Then programmed them to detect and bypass objects.

# RNAI Arduino Mega 2560 :

The Arduino Mega 2560 is a microcontroller board that is built around the ATmega2560. A 16 MHz crystal oscillator, 4 hardware serial ports, 16 analog inputs, 54 digital input/output pins (15 of which can be used as PWM outputs), a USB port, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button are all included.

# Servo Motor SG90 :

Small and reasonably priced, the SG90 servo motor finds frequent usage in robotics, do-it-yourself projects, and educational settings. It has plastic gears and is inexpensive and lightweight, making it ideal for applications requiring little torque.

# Dc Motor 12V 1200RPM :

Direct current (DC) motors are the most common type of motor. DC motors typically have one positive lead and one negative lead. If you connect these two lines directly to a battery, the motor will start. If the leads are switched, the motor will turn in the opposite direction.

# The L298N Motor Driver :

The L298N is a dual H-Bridge motor driver that can simultaneously regulate two DC motors' speeds and directions. DC motors with peak currents of up to 2A and voltages between 5 and 35V can be powered by the module.

# Batteries :

We used ( 6 ) lithium 12-volt batteries

# HuskeyLens AI Camera :

HuskyLens is an easy-to-use AI camera. It can learn to recognize things, faces, and colors just by clicking. It's intelligence grows as it learns more. The use of a next generation AI technology enables HuskyLens to detect faces at 30 frames per second. HuskyLens connects to Arduino, Raspberry Pi, LattePanda, or micro:bit, allowing you to create really creative projects without having to deal with sophisticated algorithms. HuskyLens wants to be the simplest AI camera. It already has a variety of image processing techniques built in. Pressing buttons allows you to shift between methods, and it can learn and detect new items from photographs. Furthermore, HuskyLens features a 2.0-inch display; what you see is what you get.
