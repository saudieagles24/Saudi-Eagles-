# Team Saudi Eagles (wro) future engineers
# Description:-

Since their founding, the Saudi Eagles have had one goal in mind. combining in a single vehicle the capabilities of mechanical, electrical, artificial intelligence, and cooperation. We put in the effort, kept trying, and eventually selected the right parts for our self-driving car. By doing this, we were able to make it as autonomous and efficient as possible.
The hardest challenge is definitely figuring out how to get all of these elements to interact harmoniously without changing any dynamics. Selecting the right parts is a highly challenging step since we want our car to be the best it can be.

We are dealing with a car that was constructed using A lightweight aluminum body, a 12V rechargeable lithium battery, a board compatible with Arduino, a separate motor drive control, three ultrasonic sensors for measuring distance from three directions, a color sensor to detect colors on the mattress, an artificial intelligence camera with multiple programs, color and object recognition, an interactive screen for displaying the camera view, a servo motor for steering to control the robot's direction, a differential mechanism to transfer power from one motor to two wheels, wide rubber wheels and motors running at 300 rpm.

We took great care when writing our code, going over each and every line to make sure there were no mistakes or software flaws. We made sure that each challenge is determined by our prior design, not by chance, by creating two codes.

# Ultrasonic sensor US - 100 :

An ultrasonic sensor is a device that uses ultrasonic sound waves to detect the distance to an object, such as the walls or pillars. An ultrasonic sensor transmits and receives ultrasonic pulses using a transducer to determine the proximity of an item. We employed three ultrasonic left, right, and front

# RNAI Arduino Mega 2560 :

The Arduino Mega 2560 is a microcontroller board that is built around the ATmega2560. A 16 MHz crystal oscillator, 4 hardware serial ports, 16 analog inputs, 54 digital input/output pins (15 of which can be used as PWM outputs), a USB port, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button are all included.

# Servo MG995 :

Numerous RC models, automobiles, helicopters, and planes employ the high-speed standard MG995 Metal Gear Servo Motor. It has a 180-degree rotational range (60 degrees in each direction). both 12 kg/cm at 6 V and 10 kg/cm at 4.8 V are delivered. This digital servo motor processes and receives PWM signals more quickly and efficiently.

# Dc Motor 12V 1200RPM :

Direct current (DC) motors are the most common type of motor. DC motors typically have one positive lead and one negative lead. If you connect these two lines directly to a battery, the motor will start. If the leads are switched, the motor will turn in the opposite direction.

# The L298N Motor Driver :

The L298N is a dual H-Bridge motor driver that can simultaneously regulate two DC motors' speeds and directions. DC motors with peak currents of up to 2A and voltages between 5 and 35V can be powered by the module.

# Batteries :

We used ( 6 ) 12-volt batteries

# HuskeyLens AI Camera :

HuskyLens is an easy-to-use AI camera. It can learn to recognize things, faces, and colors just by clicking. Its intelligence grows as it learns more. The use of a next generation AI technology enables HuskyLens to detect faces at 30 frames per second. HuskyLens connects to Arduino, Raspberry Pi, LattePanda, or micro:bit, allowing you to create really creative projects without having to deal with sophisticated algorithms. HuskyLens wants to be the simplest AI camera. It already has a variety of image processing techniques built in. Pressing buttons allows you to shift between methods, and it can learn and detect new items from photographs. Furthermore, HuskyLens features a 2.0-inch display; what you see is what you get!
